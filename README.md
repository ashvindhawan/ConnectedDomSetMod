# Modified Connected Dominating Set


Problem statement: Given a positive weighted, connected, undirected graph G, find a subgraph T of G such that:
1. Every vertex v âˆˆ V is either in T or adjacent to a vertex in T.
2. T is a tree.
3. The average pairwise distance between all vertices in T is minimized.

To run code, run python3 run.py to solve using all inputs. To specify a certain input, you can modify the for loop constraints that are specified for small, medium, and large to select a single input file. Main code can be found in solver.py.
